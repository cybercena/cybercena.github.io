Whenever we need to find the geolocation of an image, we can use Google Image Search, Yandex, or Bing. I used Google Images to gather information about the above image, and I discovered that it is located in Chongqing, China

Now we need to find out the sister city of Chongqing, which is located in Nepal, and the name of its mayor.
