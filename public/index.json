[{"content":"Recently, I created an OSINT challenge for Team NCA@Nepal . The challenge, called ‘Ghumantey,’ is considered the most confusing and difficult OSINT challenge in the NCA CTF. So far, only two teams have solved it at last moment.\nIn the challenge, there is a short description and an image. The image above is the one provided in the challenge. We have multiple choices to identify the location name. Participants can use image search tools such as Google Images, Yandex, Bing, etc., or check the image metadata using tools like exiftool or https://exif.tools/. In this case, I prefer exiftool over Google searching, and look what I found…\nexiftool chall.jpg I found the author name ‘chinipapa_7’ in the image. Now, we can perform OSINT on the author name. We have multiple options, such as using tools like Sherlock or https://whatsmyname.app/. In this case, I preferred Sherlock because of its powerful capabilities, and look what I found…\nAmong the multiple URLs found in the image, I discovered that https://medium.com/@chinipapa_7 could be useful because the description mentions a traveler, and travelers often use Medium for blogging. I visited the link and found a clue that can help us…\nThere is a hint for X, and the word ‘Osintphobia’ points towards the correct target. On Twitter, I found a profile with the same name, ‘Hancy Kto,’ and the username ‘chinipapa_7.\nIn the image, the words ‘pizza’ and ‘massage’ are mentioned, and there is enough information, such as the hoarding board of RE/MAX and Sharon’s Massage Center, along with a phone number. The phone number can help find the exact location, so I googled it.\nWe found the exact location of Sharon’s Massage Center: 8072 California City Blvd, California City, CA 93505. Now we can use Google Earth for a virtual tour. It’s the best tool for an OSINT challenge.\nIn the image, we can see the nearest pizzeria located near the massage center mentioned on Twitter, and the location looks the same. We have found the country name and the name of the pizzeria; now we need to find the email for DiMaggio’s. I think Google dorking will be the best for information gathering. I used: site:facebook.com \u0026quot;Dimaggio's\u0026quot; \u0026quot;California\u0026quot;\nI can choose any social media platform for dorking, but I think Facebook is the best. I clicked on one of the links and found the email.\nFrom all the info that we have collect , we got the flag that is : nca{USA_DiMaggio’s_dimaggios17@gmail.com}\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ctf/nca-ctf/ghumantey/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently, I created an OSINT challenge for Team \u003ca href=\"https://ncateam.xyz/about/\"\u003eNCA@Nepal\u003c/a\u003e\n.

From powering the devices we carry in our pockets to running complex systems that govern entire industries, computers have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. But how did we get here, and what does the future hold for computing technology? In this blog, we’ll explore the fascinating evolution of computers and their profound impact on society.\nA Brief History of Computers The concept of computing dates back centuries, with early mechanical devices like the abacus being used for basic calculations. However, the modern era of computers began in the mid-20th century.\nThe Early Days (1940s-1950s)\nThe first electronic computers were built during and after World War II, primarily for military purposes. These machines, such as the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), were enormous, often filling entire rooms and consuming massive amounts of power. They were primarily used for complex calculations and code-breaking tasks.\nThe Mainframe Era (1960s-1970s)\nAs technology progressed, computers became smaller and more powerful. Mainframe computers, like those developed by IBM, were widely adopted by businesses, universities, and government organizations. These machines could handle multiple tasks simultaneously and were pivotal in automating many processes.\nThe Personal Computer Revolution (1980s)\nThe introduction of the microprocessor in the 1970s paved the way for personal computers (PCs). Companies like Apple, IBM, and Microsoft led the charge in bringing computing power to individual users. The rise of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), user-friendly software, and affordable hardware made computers accessible to millions of people worldwide.\nThe Internet Age (1990s-2000s)\nThe invention of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s marked a new chapter in computing.
