NCA@Nepal is Nepal‚Äôs active cybersecurity community and Capture The Flag (CTF) team, where learning and sharing knowledge are at the heart of everything they do. Their motto is \u0026lsquo;Learn and Share: Growing Together in Cybersecurity\u0026rsquo;.\nIn the challenge, a short description and image were provided. You can see them in the image below: Whenever we are solving the challenge, we need to carefully read the description and set a clear goal for what we need to find out. In the image above, the term \u0026lsquo;unfinished building casting a long shadow\u0026rsquo; is mentioned. So, I began solving the challenge with the help of Google image search.I got the exact location of the place shown in the image. It is Bhatbhateni located in Bhaktapur. To confirm the location, I used Google Earth for a virtual tour. Surprisingly, I found an unfinished building in front of the Bhatbhateni as well. Now that we have the image of the unfinished building, our next step is to identify the business group that owns the building and find the first and last name of the group\u0026rsquo;s founder.\nI found multiple URLs, and I thought the YouTube video could be more useful. I was able to get all the information I needed from it. Alternatively, we can search Google for the founder of Saurabh Group. So, finally we got the flag :\nnca{saurabh_lila_neupane} Note: Google image search , yandex/images , bing and google earth are mostly used in Geo-osint challenge.\n","date":"25 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/ctf/gaganchumbi_mahal/","section":"Writeups","summary":"Gaganchumbi Mahal is an OSINT-related CTF challenge hosted by Team NCA@Nepal.","title":"NCA CTF:Gaganchumbi Mahal writeup","type":"writeups"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/osint/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"OSINT","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Sonam","summary":"","title":"Sonam","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"A stash of write-ups dissecting challenges, exploits, and machines‚Äîsorted by the platforms they were dropped on.\n","date":"25 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/","section":"Writeups","summary":"A stash of write-ups dissecting challenges, exploits, and machines‚Äîsorted by the platforms they were dropped on.","title":"Writeups","type":"list"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bhagini-sahar/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bhagini Sahar","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ghumantey/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ghumantey","type":"tags"},{"content":"Bhagini Sahar is the CTF challenge related to OSINT hosted by NCA@Nepal.

The challenge, called ‚ÄòGhumantey,‚Äô is considered the most confusing and difficult OSINT challenge in the NCA CTF. So far, only two teams have solved it at last moment.\nIn the challenge, there is a short description and an image. The image above is the one provided in the challenge. We have multiple choices to identify the location name. Participants can use image search tools such as Google Images, Yandex, Bing, etc., or check the image metadata using tools like exiftool or https://exif.tools/. In this case, I prefer exiftool over Google searching, and look what I found‚Ä¶\nexiftool chall.jpg I found the author name ‚Äòchinipapa_7‚Äô in the image. Now, we can perform OSINT on the author name. We have multiple options, such as using tools like Sherlock or https://whatsmyname.app/. In this case, I preferred Sherlock because of its powerful capabilities, and look what I found‚Ä¶\nAmong the multiple URLs found in the image, I discovered that https://medium.com/@chinipapa_7 could be useful because the description mentions a traveler, and travelers often use Medium for blogging. I visited the link and found a clue that can help us‚Ä¶\nThere is a hint for X, and the word ‚ÄòOsintphobia‚Äô points towards the correct target. On Twitter, I found a profile with the same name, ‚ÄòHancy Kto,‚Äô and the username ‚Äòchinipapa_7.\nIn the image, the words ‚Äòpizza‚Äô and ‚Äòmassage‚Äô are mentioned, and there is enough information, such as the hoarding board of RE/MAX and Sharon‚Äôs Massage Center, along with a phone number. The phone number can help find the exact location, so I googled it.\nWe found the exact location of Sharon‚Äôs Massage Center: 8072 California City Blvd, California City, CA 93505. Now we can use Google Earth for a virtual tour. It‚Äôs the best tool for an OSINT challenge.\nIn the image, we can see the nearest pizzeria located near the massage center mentioned on Twitter, and the location looks the same. We have found the country name and the name of the pizzeria; now we need to find the email for DiMaggio‚Äôs. I think Google dorking will be the best for information gathering. I used: site:facebook.com \u0026quot;Dimaggio's\u0026quot; \u0026quot;California\u0026quot;\nI can choose any social media platform for dorking, but I think Facebook is the best. I clicked on one of the links and found the email.\nFrom all the info that we have collect , we got the flag that is : nca{USA_DiMaggio‚Äôs_dimaggios17@gmail.com}\n","date":"24 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/ctf/ghumantey/","section":"Writeups","summary":"Recently, I created an OSINT challenge for Team NCA@Nepal .","title":"NCA CTF:Ghumantey writeup","type":"writeups"},{"content":" Cybersecurity learner | CTF Player # Personals: # I\u0026rsquo;m pursuing Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree (BIM) I\u0026rsquo;m a part time Cybersecurity learner I\u0026rsquo;m from Nepal Certifications # Name Issued By Verify At Introduction to Cybersecurity Cisco Verify Foundations of Cybersecurity Google Verify Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks Google Verify Networking Basics Cisco Verify Peek into my projects: GitHub Portfolio\nLatest posts: /posts\nAsk me about: # Basics of Cybersecurity Basics of Networking \u0026amp; linux Python Programming üêç ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/whoami/","section":"Sonam","summary":"Cybersecurity learner | CTF Player # Personals: # I\u0026rsquo;m pursuing Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree (BIM) I\u0026rsquo;m a part time Cybersecurity learner I\u0026rsquo;m from Nepal Certifications # Name Issued By Verify At Introduction to Cybersecurity Cisco Verify Foundations of Cybersecurity Google Verify Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks Google Verify Networking Basics Cisco Verify Peek into my projects: GitHub Portfolio","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"Check out my side projects‚Äîwhere I push code, break stuff, and build tools to tackle real-world challenges head-on.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"Check out my side projects‚Äîwhere I push code, break stuff, and build tools to tackle real-world challenges head-on.","title":"Projects","type":"list"},{"content":"Peek into my research posts, where I break down fresh vulnerabilities, unravel how they work, and drop my own discoveries.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/","section":"Research","summary":"Peek into my research posts, where I break down fresh vulnerabilities, unravel how they work, and drop my own discoveries.","title":"Research","type":"list"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
