In the video, I saw that one of our mutual friend\u0026rsquo;s Facebook accounts had been compromised. A minute later, the friend whose Facebook had been hacked called me. I asked him what had happened, and he simply told me that he had been logged out of Facebook and no longer had access.I advised him to try recovering his Facebook account by resetting the password. I also reported to Facebook that my friend\u0026rsquo;s account had been hacked and informed other friends to report the incident as well.\nRecovery # A few minutes later, my friend called me to say that his account had been recovered because he had access to his recovery email, phone, and even backup codes. After recovering his Facebook account, we talked on a video call and started investigating what had actually happened and how his account had been compromised.\nInvestigation # As part of the investigation, I asked my friend a few questions, such as:\nDid you click on any links? Did you log in to any site that looked like a Facebook login page? Did you share your login credentials with anyone? Did you receive any login alerts or Facebook password change notifications in your email? And all his answers were \u0026lsquo;NO.\u0026rsquo; I was amazed when I heard that he had even enabled 2FA and login alerts on Facebook, yet didn‚Äôt receive any OTP or alert when his account was compromised. I was even more amazed that the hacker didn‚Äôt change the email or phone number associated with the account.\nConclusion # After some investigation, we found the following evidence and concluded that it was nothing other than cookie theft. Here are the reasons that led to this conclusion:\nThe hacker logged in from Hungary with the IP address 154.218.25.40, and when we tracked the IP, it was indeed from Hungary. The hacker did not change the email or phone number, did not perform any activities that required a password, and only changed information that didn‚Äôt require a password. The hacker changed the profile picture, but when we performed a reverse image search, it was easily found on Google. Facebook did not send any login alerts and didn‚Äôt ask for an OTP for 2FA because this was not a new login. The hacker stole our cookie and used it, so Facebook recognized them as the same person.\nFacebook doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a password to change the name, so the hacker changed my friend\u0026rsquo;s name. Even after we got the account back, it took 60 days to change the Facebook name. Facebook should implement a password requirement feature for changing the name.\nTo confirm the hypothesis, I tried the same thing on my account. I have two accounts, and I copied the cookies from my primary account to my secondary account. I was successfully able to access the primary account on another device, and I even changed the name of the primary account. There was not a single notification from Facebook.\nPossible reason behind cookie theft # According to the conversation between me and my friend, he claimed that he hadn‚Äôt clicked any suspicious links or shared his credentials. However, he had downloaded some pirated Windows applications and visited a site that was marked as unsafe. We‚Äôre not sure how our cookie was stolen, but this could be the reason.\nSafety measures # To be safe from cookie theft and account takeover, follow these measures:\nUse Secure website (HTTPs Only) Enable login Alerts and 2FA. Store backup codes for account recovery in safe place. Don\u0026rsquo;t visit untrusted sites . Donot download pirated applications and .apk files.

It serves as an essential platform for version control and code backup, enabling seamless collaboration and teamwork.\nDevelopers and programmers often place blind trust in GitHub when deploying their code. However, misconfiguration has become one of the biggest emerging issues in the security of the digital world.\nHow Emails are Exposed # GitHub has a default feature that can expose your email address to anyone. While this is not a vulnerability, GitHub does offer an option to hide your email. However, many users are unaware of this setting. Let‚Äôs explore how your email can be revealed and how to prevent it from happening.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s visit the repository of the target whose email you want to check. Click on any commit, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see the full commit URL in your browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar. To reveal the email address, simply add .patch to the end of the URL, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see the associated email address.\nHow to Hide your Email # To prevent your email from being exposed, follow these steps:\nGo to github settings : Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select \u0026ldquo;Settings.\u0026rdquo; Navigate to Emails: Under the \u0026ldquo;Emails\u0026rdquo; section, check the option to Keep my email address private. Enable Email Privacy: Select the box that says \u0026ldquo;Block command line pushes that expose my email.\u0026rdquo; Use a GitHub-Provided Email: You can also choose to use a GitHub-generated email address (e.g., username@users.noreply.github.com) to keep your personal email address hidden while still contributing to public repositories. By enabling these features, you can ensure your email address remains protected and avoid unintentional exposure.\n","date":"13 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/github_email_leak/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Introduction: # GitHub is one of the most significant and widely used tools by IT professionals and developers.","title":"GitHub Email Leak","type":"blogs"},{"content":" Recently, I got the chance to play the WSC CTF challenge organized by We Shield Cyber and sponsored by NCA Nepal and Hack@sec.

Now I\u0026#39;ll head off to join them right away now we have to unzip the zip file but we don\u0026rsquo;t have password. after reading the text files i got some hint such as,\u0026ldquo;non sensical phrases\u0026rdquo; and I saw strange pattern in the message and when i gathered it i got :\nTHEDIEISCAST which can be pronounced as THE DIE IS CAST. since eris often uses latin pharse, i tried chatgpt for the meaning of The Die is cast and got iacta alea est which is also available in Ad meliora text file in git so , I tried it as password.\n‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(cybercena„âøkali)-[~/Desktop/DearDiary/_diary.jpg.extracted] ‚îî‚îÄ$ unzip file.zip Archive: file.zip [file.zip] file.txt password: inflating: file.txt ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(cybercena„âøkali)-[~/Desktop/DearDiary/_diary.jpg.extracted] ‚îî‚îÄ$ ls 16sep24 17sep24 18sep24 19sep24 20sep24 26184.zip file.txt file.zip ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(cybercena„âøkali)-[~/Desktop/DearDiary/_diary.jpg.extracted] ‚îî‚îÄ$ cat file.txt Hi.

You can see them in the image below: Whenever we are solving the challenge, we need to carefully read the description and set a clear goal for what we need to find out. In the image above, the term \u0026lsquo;unfinished building casting a long shadow\u0026rsquo; is mentioned. So, I began solving the challenge with the help of Google image search.I got the exact location of the place shown in the image. It is Bhatbhateni located in Bhaktapur. To confirm the location, I used Google Earth for a virtual tour. Surprisingly, I found an unfinished building in front of the Bhatbhateni as well. Now that we have the image of the unfinished building, our next step is to identify the business group that owns the building and find the first and last name of the group\u0026rsquo;s founder.\nI found multiple URLs, and I thought the YouTube video could be more useful. I was able to get all the information I needed from it. Alternatively, we can search Google for the founder of Saurabh Group. So, finally we got the flag :\nnca{saurabh_lila_neupane} Note: Google image search , yandex/images , bing and google earth are mostly used in Geo-osint challenge.\n","date":"25 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/ctf/ncactf/gaganchumbi_mahal/","section":"Writeups","summary":"Gaganchumbi Mahal is an OSINT-related CTF challenge hosted by Team NCA@Nepal.","title":"Gaganchumbi Mahal","type":"writeups"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nca-ctf/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NCA CTF","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bhagini-sahar/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bhagini Sahar","type":"tags"},{"content":"Bhagini Sahar is the CTF challenge related to OSINT hosted by NCA@Nepal.

The challenge, called ‚ÄòGhumantey,‚Äô is considered the most confusing and difficult OSINT challenge in the NCA CTF. So far, only two teams have solved it at last moment.\nIn the challenge, there is a short description and an image. The image above is the one provided in the challenge. We have multiple choices to identify the location name. Participants can use image search tools such as Google Images, Yandex, Bing, etc., or check the image metadata using tools like exiftool or https://exif.tools/. In this case, I prefer exiftool over Google searching, and look what I found‚Ä¶\nexiftool chall.jpg I found the author name ‚Äòchinipapa_7‚Äô in the image. Now, we can perform OSINT on the author name. We have multiple options, such as using tools like Sherlock or https://whatsmyname.app/. In this case, I preferred Sherlock because of its powerful capabilities, and look what I found‚Ä¶\nAmong the multiple URLs found in the image, I discovered that https://medium.com/@chinipapa_7 could be useful because the description mentions a traveler, and travelers often use Medium for blogging. I visited the link and found a clue that can help us‚Ä¶\nThere is a hint for X, and the word ‚ÄòOsintphobia‚Äô points towards the correct target. On Twitter, I found a profile with the same name, ‚ÄòHancy Kto,‚Äô and the username ‚Äòchinipapa_7.\nIn the image, the words ‚Äòpizza‚Äô and ‚Äòmassage‚Äô are mentioned, and there is enough information, such as the hoarding board of RE/MAX and Sharon‚Äôs Massage Center, along with a phone number. The phone number can help find the exact location, so I googled it.\nWe found the exact location of Sharon‚Äôs Massage Center: 8072 California City Blvd, California City, CA 93505. Now we can use Google Earth for a virtual tour. It‚Äôs the best tool for an OSINT challenge.\nIn the image, we can see the nearest pizzeria located near the massage center mentioned on Twitter, and the location looks the same. We have found the country name and the name of the pizzeria; now we need to find the email for DiMaggio‚Äôs. I think Google dorking will be the best for information gathering. I used: site:facebook.com \u0026quot;Dimaggio's\u0026quot; \u0026quot;California\u0026quot;\nI can choose any social media platform for dorking, but I think Facebook is the best.
